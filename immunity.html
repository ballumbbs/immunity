    The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and molecules that work together to defend the body against infections and diseases. It can be broadly categorized into two main components: the humoral immune system and the cellular immune system. These components work in concert to identify and eliminate pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Humoral Immune System:
The humoral immune system primarily involves the production and circulation of antibodies, which are also known as immunoglobulins (Ig). This component of the immune system is primarily responsible for dealing with extracellular pathogens, such as bacter

Antibodies (Immunoglobulins): Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by specialized white blood cells called B lymphocytes (B cells). There are several types of antibodies, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. Each type of antibody has specific func

IgG: These are the most common antibodies in the bloodstream and are involved in neutralizing toxins and pathogens.
IgM: These antibodies are typically the first to be produced during an initial infection and play a role in activating the complement system to enhance pathogen elimination.
IgA: These antibodies are found in mucosal secretions, such as saliva and tears, and help protect against infections at mucous membrane surfaces.
IgD: The exact function of IgD is less understood, but it is present on the surface of B cells and may play a role in B cell activation.
IgE: IgE antibodies are involved in allergic responses and defense against parasites.
B Cells: B lymphocytes are white blood cells responsible for producing antibodies. When they encounter an antigen (a foreign substance or pathogen), they differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies specific to that antigen.

Cellular Immune System:
The cellular immune system involves various types of white blood cells, particularly T lymphocytes (T cells). It primarily deals with intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria, as well as cancerous cells.

T Cells: T lymphocytes come in several types, including cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), helper T cells (CD4+), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). These cells have specific functions:

Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+): These T cells are responsible for directly killing infected or abnormal cells by releasing toxic molecules.
Helper T Cells (CD4+): Helper T cells play a central role in coordinating the immune response by assisting B cells in antibody production and activating cytotoxic T cells.
Regulatory T Cells (Tregs): These T cells help regulate the immune response, preventing it from becoming overly aggressive and causing autoimmune reactions.
Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs): Cells like dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells act as APCs. They capture and process antigens and present them to T cells, initiating immune responses.
